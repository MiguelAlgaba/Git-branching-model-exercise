This is just a dummy test to verify that every time someone makes a commit in the repository, Github notifies Jenkins to trigger a job. I have added some text here again, because the first time I made a commit, it didn't work. I have made another modification to this file to see if the results from CTests are now visible in Jenkins-master using JUnit report.
